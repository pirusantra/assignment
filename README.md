# CRUD Operations with Java and MySQL

This repository contains a Java application that demonstrates CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations with MySQL database.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, ensure you have the following installed on your local machine:

- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- MySQL Server
- MySQL Connector/J (JDBC driver for MySQL)

Project Development:
1. Creating the Registration Table:
Created a MySQL database.
Designed a 'Registration' table with appropriate fields such as ID, Name, Email, DateOfBirth, etc., to store user registration information.
2. Setting up Java Project and JDBC Connection:
Set up a Java project in Eclipse IDE.
Included MySQL Connector/J (JDBC driver) in the project dependencies.
Established a connection between the Java application and MySQL database using JDBC.
Configured connection parameters such as URL, username, and password in the Java code to establish the connection.
3. CRUD Operations Implementation:
   
Create Operation:
Implemented the creation of new records in the 'Registration' table.
Used SQL INSERT statements to insert new records into the table.

Read Operation:
Implemented retrieval of records from the 'Registration' table.
Used SQL SELECT statements to fetch records from the table.
Utilized ResultSet to iterate through the fetched records and display them.

Update Operation:
Implemented updating of existing records in the 'Registration' table.
Used SQL UPDATE statements to modify records in the table based on certain conditions.

Delete Operation:
Implemented deletion of records from the 'Registration' table.
Used SQL DELETE statements to remove records from the table based on specified conditions.

Summary:
Created a robust system for managing user registration information.
Established a seamless connection between the Java application and MySQL database.
Implemented CRUD operations to efficiently manage user data within the database.
This project demonstrates the integration of Java and MySQL technologies to perform fundamental database operations effectively.
